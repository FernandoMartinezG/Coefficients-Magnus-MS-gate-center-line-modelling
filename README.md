# Analytical and experimental study of center line miscalibrations in Mølmer-Sørensen gates

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05447), we study a systematic perturbative expansion in miscalibrated parameters of the Mølmer-Sørensen entangling gate, which is widely used in trapped ion quantum processors. Via a unitary Magnus expansion, we obtain the gate evolution operator which allows us to obtain relevent parameter such as relative phases, electronic population, quantum state purity and fidelities. In the notebook here, we present the code for the numerical calculation of the first and second order coefficients appearing in the Magnus expansion for the time evolution operator modelling  the center line miscalibration of the Mølmer-Sørensen gate.
